**05-10-2020 Submission:**<br>
This first iteration submission is the "final" product of my CS3330 (Object-Oriented Programming) final project. The plan for this assignment is to take this project, replace the preexisting login page with an SSO page (if possible), and turn it in to a more functional application. There is not much to show for in terms of SSO addition because I'm still in the process of learning how to impliment it into a java project such as this one. I'm currently looking into [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/01/29/java-single-sign-on) which seems like it might work for what I'm trying to accomplish. For now, if you choose to run the application to see what is looks like, follow these steps:
1. Clone the `Semester-Project` folder to your machine (or the whole repo)
2. Navigate to where you cloned the folder(s)
3. Navigate to `../Gtsfq5FoodLogger/dist`
4. Run the `Gtsfq5FoodLogger.jar` file
