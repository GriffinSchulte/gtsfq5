# Comments

The CHAOSS Evolution Working Group call on April 8, 2020 was focused around pull requests that were submitted by students regarding new metrics for the working group. Before getting into those metrics, Professor Goggins and Carter went over the call document and added notes that needed to be added regarding commit issues, meeting times, etc. Upon reviewing pull requests, Carter suggested that the template for the metrics was incorrect and needed to be fixed. They fixed the template then began reviewing the first pull request, which was tracking inactive contributors. The main focus for this review was to fix any formatting errors, spelling mistakes, redundant information, and the overall efficiency in describing the propsed metric. The next pull request review was for a metric regarding code length. The workflow for this review was very similar to that of the first review.

## Note

I submitted my metric (Risk - Average Time of Open Issue) as a pull request to be reviewed rather than creating my own project. I added my two readings notes to the Slack channel and added 3 comments to others notes.
