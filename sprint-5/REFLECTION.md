# What Worked

I actually did not run into any issues with this assignment. The only thing I was confused on was what needed to be submitted, but that was quickly solved. The example applications we were to build went extremely smoothly and were completed first try with no errors or issues.

# Functionality Hopes

At the end of the semester, I'd like to have a better understanding of SSO as a whole, and how to implement a few SSO projects into my own applications. For this assignment specifically, I'd like to have a more complete look for my login implemented and a few functioning components of the actual application.
