# How To Run Application

For this assignment, I followed the Flask Google login example.
1. Clone Repository
2. Navigate to `../sprint-5/my-google` within your command line interface of choice
3. Choice:
    1. Install with Pipenv using `pipenv install`
    2. Install without Pipenv using `pip install -r requirements.txt **(This is the one I did)**
4. Initialize the database by running app.py for the first time using `python app.py`
    * Should see "Initializing the database."
5. Run the command again using `python app.py`
6. Note or copy the address `https://127.0.0.1:5000` and paste it into your broswer of choice
7. Navigate past the warning screen, and login.
