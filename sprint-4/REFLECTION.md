# Potential Project Choices

- **Sails** - The project I went with.
- Hydra
- Keycloak
- JOSSO
- Gluu

# Why I Chose Sails

I chose Sails out of all the other options because it seemed to be the most user friendly, and the documentation for installation and quick set up was easier than most all of the other options. Professor Goggins also unintionally helped persuade me into using Sails when he was covering its installation in his office hours on Zoom. Another factor that helped me choose sails was the website's design. The website it very easy to follow and inviting due to its use of color, images, and space. Their website is a good example of one that would grab a potential users attention even before that user knew of the project's features.

# How Far I Got

Based off of this assignments requirements, I think I was able to complete everything. The quick installation creates an instance of Sails that has a lot of basic functionality, including SSO. It does not require any configuration to meet the assignments requirements and essentially works "out of the box." Assuming I'm understanding the assignment correctly, I believe I did what was required.

# Obstacles I Encountered

The only obstacle I encountered was understanding what the assignment was asking. Before this assignment, while I had heard of SSO before, I wasn't fully aware of what it was. While reading the assignment instructions, my interpretation of the task was that we needed to code a simple login page and implement one of these open source projects that would allow our login to use SSO. After talking with Professor Goggins about my confusion with the assignment, he helped guide me in the right direction and further understand what SSO is and how we were to go about using it. The assignment was a lot less complicated that I was making it out to be, and was a lot easier to complete once I came to this understanding.
