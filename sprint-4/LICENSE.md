# License of Preference

There are many open source software licenses to choose from as open source becomes more popular. When I think of open source software, I think of free, community-driven software that is available for anyone who has the knowledge and desire to work with, or on it. Given this idea and belief, the license I would choose for my own open source projects would be the MIT License. The MIT license seemingly fits my idea perfectly and accomplishes how I would want my software to be used. Information on the MIT License can be found here: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
